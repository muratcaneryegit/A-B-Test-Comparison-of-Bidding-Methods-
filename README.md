TASK
To perform the A/B test, hypotheses will first be created. Afterwards, an Assumption Check will be made. Depending on the result of the Assumption Check, parametric or non-parametric testing will be applied to the hypothesis. Finally, the evaluation will be made according to the p-value obtained.


RESULT
